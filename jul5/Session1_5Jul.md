## 🌍 The Decimal (Base 10) System and Fun Facts

### 1. **Decimal Origins**
- The **decimal system** likely developed because humans have **10 fingers**—making it a natural counting base.

### 2. **The Idea of Zero**
- **Zero** as a written digit originated in **ancient India** (5th century). Before that, Egyptians and Romans had no true zero in their number systems.
- Zero is essential for **place value notation** (e.g., distinguishing between 10 and 100).

### 3. **Decimal Point History**
- The modern **decimal point** was popularized by John Napier (Scotsman, 16th-17th c.). Earlier, Babylonians used fractions and the Greeks used a vertical bar.

## 🧩 Exotic Number Systems: Base 1 and Base 0

### 4. **Base 1 – The Unary System**
- **Unary** (base 1) is the simplest number system: each count is a tally mark (e.g., ||||| for 5).
- There are **no place values**; just repeat the single symbol.
- Computers sometimes use unary for sorting or "tally circuits," but it's highly inefficient for large numbers.
- **Fun fact:** Some animals (and very young children) "count" in unary: one object means one mark!

### 5. **Base 0 – Does Not Exist**
- **Base 0** is **impossible**: you can't have a numbering system with no symbols for digits, and you can't represent numbers with a "zero base."
- There’s no place value, no digits; only the concept of nothingness.

## 🦄 Weird and Wonderful Numeral Bases

### 6. **Non-Integer and Imaginary Bases**
- You can have **non-integer bases**: e.g., base 𝜙 (golden ratio base), where place values are powers of the golden ratio ≈ 1.618.
- There are even **complex** (e.g., "base −2", "base i") bases, used in theoretical math.

### 7. **Negabinary (Base −2)**
- In base −2, numbers alternate signs per digit position. For example, 1101 in base −2 equals −3 in decimal.
- Negabinary can represent both positive and negative integers without separate minus signs!

### 8. **Balanced Ternary (Base 3, Digits: −1, 0, 1)**
- Used in early Russian computers (Setun).
- Each digit is −1, 0, or 1, often written as “−”, “0”, “+”.
- Useful in minimizing circuit complexity.

### 9. **Sexagesimal (Base 60)**
- Ancient Babylonians used **base 60**. Our minutes and seconds divisions, and some geometry (360 degrees), come from this system.

## 🏛️ History & Influence

### 10. **Why Base 12, Base 20 Exist**
- Many cultures used **other bases**:
  - **Base 12** (dozenal): Divides evenly into thirds and fourths (12 eggs in a “dozen").
  - **Base 20** (vigesimal): Used by the **Mayan civilization** and certain African and European languages.

### 11. **Roman Numerals: No Place Value**
- Romans used no place value or zero; "IX" (9) is just "one less than ten."
- Leads to awkward arithmetic, unlike position-based decimals.

## 🤯 Mind-Blowing Number System Facts

| Base | Name        | Key Features                                         | Example                      |
|------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| 1    | Unary       | No place value; just marks.                          |  ||||| for 5                 |
| 0    | Impossible  | Can't exist as a numbering system.                   |  Not usable                  |
| -2   | Negabinary  | Signs alternate; can show +/− numbers natively.      | 11010₋₂ = 6                  |
| φ    | Golden base | Non-integer; based on golden ratio.                  | φ² + 0×φ + 1 = 2.618…        |
| 60   | Sexagesimal | Divides time (Babylonian).                           | 1:59:59 (hours:minutes:secs) |

## 🦠 **Even Stranger: Non-Positional Systems**

- **Roman numerals, tally marks**: Not positional at all.
- **Counting rods**: Used in ancient China, with position and rod orientation for values.

## 🏁 Summary

- The **decimal system** is the most used, but it's not the only way humans (or computers, or mathematicians) can represent numbers.
- **Unary** is inefficient, but conceptually simple.
- **Base 0** can't exist—but it's a fun thought experiment!
- There are **imaginary, negative, non-integer bases** in pure math!
- Our time system and angles reflect ancient base 60 ideas.
- Every base brings unique quirks!
