    "## Calculate Interest\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Topic:** *Calculate Interest*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "When someone deposits or borrows money, the amount often grows over time due to *interest*. There are two common types of interest: **Simple Interest** and **Compound Interest**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we'll focus on **Simple Interest**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Principal (P):** The original amount of money deposited or borrowed.\n",
    "* **Rate of Interest (R):** The percentage charged or earned on the principal each year.\n",
    "* **Time (T):** The number of years the money is deposited or borrowed for.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula to calculate **Simple Interest** is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Interest = (Principal √ó Rate √ó Time) / 100\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us the amount of money earned or paid as interest after the given time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Problem Statement:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function named `calculate_interest` that takes the following three arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `principal` (amount of money deposited or borrowed),\n",
    "* `rate` (rate of interest per year, as a percentage),\n",
    "* `time` (duration in years),\n",
    "\n",
    "and returns the simple interest calculated using the formula above.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example Usage:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "calculate_interest(1000, 5, 2)   # Output: 100.0\n",
    "calculate_interest(1500, 4.3, 3) # Output: 193.5\n",

    "#### üìò Understanding the Terms (in simple language):\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have a right-angled triangle (a triangle where one of the angles is exactly 90 degrees), the longest side of the triangle is called the **hypotenuse**. It‚Äôs the side that is **opposite the right angle**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other two sides (the ones that make the right angle) are usually called the **base** and the **height** (or **perpendicular**).\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the length of the hypotenuse, we use something called the **Pythagorean Theorem**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "hypotenuse¬≤ = base¬≤ + height¬≤\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the hypotenuse, we need to take the square root of the sum of the squares of the base and height:\n",
    "\n",
